								<h5>Vector vs. Rastor file types</h5>
								<p>There are two main types of files used in graphic design; vector files, and rastor files. It is important to understand the difference, and when to use them. These file types are generated using professional graphic design software; such as Adobe Suite, Affinity, or Corel software.</p>
								<h5>What is a vector file?</h5>
								<p>Vector design files are the industry standard and use points and bezier curves rather than pixes. As seen in the above image, the "Vector" has points and curves that can be controlled for precision designs.</p>
								<h5>What is a rastor file?</h5>
								<p>Rastor design files are used primarily for photography, or anything that requires pixel manipulation. Although you can create logos with these tools, it is important to know how you'll use these files.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<div class="card-content">
								<h4>Understanding File Types</h4>
								<p>Most professional designers will work with vector files. Popular vector filetypes are .ai, .eps, and .pdf (if exported from vector editing program). Popular rastor files types are .jpg, .png, .tiff, .pdf (if exported from a rastor editing program)</p>
								<h5>Filetypes we require</h5>
								<p>We require vector files (.ai, or .eps) for signmaking. This is due to our equipment and estimating tools. If vector files aren't provided, we can re-create the artwork for a fee. Your designer, or management team should have all required design files.</p>
								<p>Note: rastor files cannot be converted to a vector file without manipulation. A rastor file, placed and exported in an .ai, or .eps format does not convert it to a vector file.</p>
								<h5>What if I don't have access to the design files?</h5>
								<p>If you don't have access to the design files we'll have to re-create the artwork to the best of our ability. This doesn't ensure a 100% match of your current branding, and a fee will be applied. Proper images of the design must be provided.</p>

									<h4>Permissions Check</h4>
									<p>Using artwork from other designers, or brands, prior to securing permission to use is considered theft, or copyright infringement. Permission can be as simple as obtaining a documented email confirmation or sales receipt, but might require a licence, or royalty fees. Check with your designer for artwork permissions, and never assume content is free to use.</p>

									<h5>All fonts are free right?</h5>
									<p>No, fonts are treated just like artwork and therefore they have the same copyright laws applied. There are thousands of fonts, from various foundries, and knowing which one your brand uses is critical to maintaining your brand across all channels.</p>
									<h5>How do I know which fonts I can use?</h5>
									<p>You must check whether a font has an End User Licence Agreement, or EULA. There you will find the specifics of how you can, and can't use their font.</p>
									<h5>Free fonts are aplenty</h5>
									<p>If you are unsure what type of font you have, or if you have permission to use a font, it is best to look around. There are several sources that provide open-source fonts that can be used for personal or commercial work.</p>

									<h4>Understanding Typefaces</h4>
									<p>No two fonts are created equal. Some have a limited amount of characters, and some don't have upper and lower case characters. Although there are several categories, the big three are: display, sans-serif, and serif fonts.
									</p>
									<h5>Display typefaces</h5>
									<p>Usually used as a header, or some other bold statement, these wouldn't be used for primary content. Commonly used for logos or statement text, best to think of a comic book typeface as a display type.</p>
									<h5>Serif typefaces</h5>
									<p>Serif typefaces are used primarily for print copy, and for the best optical flow. Generally they are identified by their feet, or flairs that come off of the letters.</p>
									<p><strong>Popular serif fonts include:</strong> Didot, Times New Roman, and Garamond.</p>
									<h5>Sans-serif typefaces</h5>
									<p>These are highly versitile and make for quick legible copy. You can get great formatting by using them in different weights and kerning. These fonts differ from Serif fonts because they don't have feet or flairs on them; hence the name, sans-serif.</p>
									<p><strong>Popular sans-serif fonts include:</strong> Helvetica, Montserrat, Ariel, and Roboto.</p>

										<h4>Permissions Check</h4>
										<p>Attaining proper usage rights are critical when using fonts. End User License Agreements (EULA) cover various criteria. Often this criteria includes usage rights per media. For instance, if you were making a website and used a specific font, you might need to pay per user/viewer of the site. Unless the font is specifically open-source, or free for personal and commercial use, you must be aware of the EULA. Follow up with the font designer, or foundry to learn which license you need. Avoid copyright issues by purchasing a licence if required.</p>

										<p>Colors are such an important component of your brand to get right. They can be so powerful that people automatically associate them with your brand. Colors can create customer loyalty, envoke feelings of trust, or share a certain emotion. Recording your brand colors is relatively simple, but can add a tremendous amount of value to your business in the long run.</p>
										<h5>What is a color code?</h5>
										<p>Color codes are used to define a certain color mixture. There are different color codes for various mediums. For instance, printing usually requires Pantone colors, websites commonly use Hex values, and printers use CMYK colors. <strong>We generally require Pantone colors to match you company branding.</strong></p>

									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="card">
									<div class="card-content">
										<h4>Color Variations</h4>
										<p>Colors can vary given the different mediums that they are presented in. For instance, a color on the web might look completely different than the same color printed out. When a brand requires a specific color, that is called a spot color. There is no gurantee that colors will be 100% accurate, but with proper color documentation, you can greatly reduce color variations.</p>

									<div class="card-content-permission">
										<div class="content">
											<h4>Permissions Check</h4>
											<p>Believe it or not, brands can trademark certain colors. For instance: Tiffany uses Tiffany blue, and Coca-Cola uses a specific red. Assuming your specific industry, you might be barred from using a color that shares a likeness to a particular brands trademarked color scheme.  </p>
