								<h5>Vector vs. Rastor file types</h5>
								<p>There are two main types of files used in graphic design: vector and raster. It is important to understand the difference and when to use them. These file types are generated using professional graphic design software such as Adobe Suite, Affinity, or Corel.</p>
								<h5>What is a vector file?</h5>
								<p>Vector files are the industry standard and use points and Bézier curves rather than pixels. As seen in the above image, the vector has points and curves that can be controlled for creating precise designs. Vector art can scale without image degredation. <strong>If possible, CNI requires all fonts to be outlined to ensure accuracy.</strong></p>
								<h5>What is a rastor file?</h5>
								<p>Raster files are used primarily for photography or anything that requires the manipulation of individual pixels. Although you can create logos with these tools, it is important to know how you'll use these files.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<div class="card-content">
								<h4>Understanding File Types</h4>
								<p>Most professional designers will work with vector files. Popular vector filetypes are .ai, .eps, and .pdf (if exported from vector editing program). Popular rastor files types are .jpg, .png, .tiff, .pdf (if exported from a rastor editing program)</p>
								<h5>Required File Types</h5>
								<p>At CNI, we require vector files (.ai, .eps, and some .pdf) for sign making due to our equipment and estimating tools. If vector files cannot be provided, we can re-create the original artwork in vector format for an additional cost if you decide to use CNI.</p>
								<p>Raster files (.jpg, .png, .tiff, and some .pdf) cannot be automatically converted into vector files. They require manual manipulation by a designer.</p>
								<h5>What if I don't have access to design files?</h5>
								<p>Designers or management teams typically have access to these types of files, but if they are not available, we can re-create close facsimiles of the original artwork. This does not guarantee a 100% match of your current branding, but it will be very close. A fee will apply, and proper images of any design must be provided.</p>

									<h4>Permissions Check</h4>
									<p>Using artwork from other designers or brands prior to securing permission to use is considered theft or copyright infringement. Permission can be as simple as obtaining a documented email confirmation or a sales receipt but could possibly require a license or royalty fees. Check with your designer for artwork permissions, and never assume content is free to use.</p>

									<h5>All fonts are free, right?</h5>
									<p>No, unfortunately they aren’t. Fonts are treated just like artwork and therefore the same copyright laws apply. There are thousands of fonts from various foundries and knowing which one your brand uses is critical to maintaining your brand across all channels.</p>
									<h5>How do I know which fonts I can use?</h5>
									<p>You must check whether a font has an End User License Agreement, or EULA. There you will find the specifics of how you can and can't use the font.</p>
									<h5>Plenty of free fonts</h5>
									<p>If you are unsure what type of font you have, it is best to look around for one you are sure you can use. There are several sources that provide open-source fonts that can be used for either personal or commercial work.</p>

								<div class="card-content">
									<h4>Understanding Typefaces</h4>
									<p>No two fonts are created equally. For example, some have a limited amount of characters and some don't have upper- and lowercase characters. Although there are several categories of fonts, the “big three” are display, sans-serif, and serif.
									</p>
									<h5>Display typefaces</h5>
									<p>Usually used in headers, logos, or other bold visual statements, display typefaces are not intended for primary content.</p>
									<h5>Serif typefaces</h5>
									<p>Serif typefaces are used primarily for print copy and for the best optical flow. Generally, they are identified by their feet, or flairs, that come off the letters. Popular serif fonts include Didot, Times New Roman, and Garamond.</p>
									<h5>Sans-serif typefaces</h5>
									<p>These are highly versatile and make for quick, legible copy. You can get great formatting by using them in different weights and kerning. These fonts differ from serif fonts because they don't have feet or flairs on them; hence the name, sans-serif. Popular sans-serif fonts include Helvetica, Montserrat, Ariel, and Roboto.</p>

								<div class="card-content-permission">
									<div class="content">
										<h4>Permissions Check</h4>
										<p>Attaining proper usage rights are critical when using fonts. End User License Agreements (EULAs) cover various criteria. Often these criteria include usage rights per media. For instance, if you were making a website and used a specific font, you might need to pay per user/viewer of the site. Unless the font is specifically open-source (free for personal and commercial use), you must be aware of the EULA. Follow up with the font designer or foundry to learn which license you need. Avoid copyright issues by purchasing a license if required.</p>

										<div class="img-colors"></div>
										<p>Colors are a crucial component of any brand and must be done right. They can be so powerful that people automatically associate them with a given brand. Colors can create customer loyalty, evoke feelings of trust, or convey a certain emotion. Documenting your brand colors is relatively simple but can add a tremendous amount of value to your business in the long run.</p>
										<h5>What is a color code?</h5>
										<p>Color codes are used to define a certain color mixture. There are different color codes for various mediums. For instance, printing usually requires Pantone colors, websites commonly use Hex values, and printers use CMYK colors. CNI generally requires Pantone colors to match your company branding. <strong>CNI requires Pantone colors, or any other professional paint brand, to match your company branding.</strong></p>

								</div>
								<div class="card">
									<div class="card-content">
										<h4>Color Variations</h4>
										<p>Colors can vary depending on the medium they are presented in. For instance, a color on the web might look completely different than the same color printed out. When a brand requires a specific color, that is called a spot color. There is no guarantee that colors will be 100% accurate, but with proper color documentation, you can greatly reduce unwanted variations.</p>

											<h4>Permissions Check</h4>
											<p>Believe it or not, brands can trademark certain colors. For instance, Tiffany uses Tiffany Blue and Coca-Cola uses a specific red. In your specific industry, you might be barred from using a certain color that shares a likeness to a particular brand’s trademarked color scheme.</p>
